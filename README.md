### Features
<br>
Following are some of the new features and learning encountered while creating this amazing project:

- <b>Donation portal:</b><br> The website will be using blockchain technology to ensure secure and a transparent portal for donation.

- <b>Payment gateways:</b><br> The portal will provide multiple payment gateways to select from such credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers.

- <b>Donor management:</b><br> The website would store latest information of donors including their donation history, and communication preferences using various donor management tools that could be used by charities

- <b>Fundraising campaigns:</b><br> The website will feature various fundraising campaigns including their clear goals and progress.

- <b>Payment receipts:</b><br> The website will provide receipts to donors when making a donation or payment.

- <b>Gamification:</b><br> The website will provide social sharing options to enable donors to share about their experiences and donations on social media, increasing awareness and to encourage others to be a part of the initiative.

- <b>Volunteering opportunities:</b><br> The website would provide information on volunteer opportunities, including how to sign up and what kind of help is needed.

- Newsletter:</b><br> The website will also provide latest news and updates on various charitable activities and the impact, which will help donors remain engaged. 

Overall, this initiative will have wide range of features designed to make donating transparent and secure. By seamlessly
connecting the act of giving with the vast networks of social media, we amplify the visibility of charitable causes, encouraging a broader community to participate in the spirit of giving. This approach transforms passive donors into active advocates, leveraging the power of
social networks to create a ripple effect of support for charitable initiatives. Moreover, the gamification elements, such as badges and leaderboards, add an element of fun and competition to the donation process, incentivizing continued engagement and fostering a
sense of accomplishment among donors.
